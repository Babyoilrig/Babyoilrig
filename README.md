About me:
---------
Following a ten year career as a primary school teacher, I learned to code in 2022 with the [School of Code](https://schoolofcode.co.uk/). Following the bootcamp, and initially unsure of the route I wanted to take, I spent a year project managing web builds in a tech related role. Having realised that I really wanted to be a dev, I spent 2023 honing my coding skills and completed an internship between Jan-June 2024 with [Vista Health](https://vista.health/) in which I built a large and complex application for a blue chip pharmaceutical firm to display their global sales data. I am currently working as a Junior Software Engineer with a large solicitors.
<br/><br/>
* I am an enthusiastic and friendly individual with excellent communication and listening skills, 
who thrives when working as part of a team.

* I love learning new things, and I also love a challenge!

* I am an independent, resourceful self-starter that can organise projects from start to finish, 
and ensure that they are completed to a very high standard.

* I have a good understanding of business, management and marketing - 
having studied business for 7 years and run my own events business.


Fun facts:
----------


* I previously worked as a primary school teacher for ten years.

* I have two daughters aged 4 and 8.

* I am a MASSIVE music fan. I love everything from Alan Lomax's early recordings, to heavy metal, pop, northern soul, acid house, punk and post-punk and everything in between!

* I love to travel.

* I am very creative, and love art, graphic design and fashion.
